# Maximizing Profit: Targeted Restocking and VIP Customer Engagement for Sustainable Growth

## Project Overview
This project analyzes inventory and customer data to identify strategies for optimizing profits. By evaluating sales performance, customer behaviors, and stock levels, the analysis provides actionable insights for effective inventory management and targeted marketing efforts.

## Goals
- Determine which products to restock based on low stock ratios and sales performance.
- Identify VIP and less-engaged customers to tailor marketing strategies.
- Assess the feasibility of acquiring new customers based on historical trends.

## Approach
The analysis employs SQL queries to aggregate and manipulate data from the database. Key metrics, such as profit per customer and stock ratios, are calculated using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to enhance clarity and efficiency.

## Key Findings
- Certain products require urgent restocking based on their sales performance and stock levels.
- VIP customers contribute significantly to overall profits, while less-engaged customers present opportunities for improvement.
- The Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) indicates potential for investing in customer acquisition strategies.

## Technologies Used
- SQLite for data manipulation and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook for documenting the analysis process.
